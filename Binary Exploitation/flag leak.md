# Solution
Running it in the terminal 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20a91e8-b9d1-45aa-88cc-f29b59c2cda5)

It returns whatever we give as an input , since the hint is given as "format strings" and looking in the code to see that

As the bufsize is set to 64 i tried to overflow it by using lot of characters but that didnt work  and it only printed till 64 characters of whatever 
i gave as an input.

Now while trying to input different formats numbers or format speciefers ( cuz the hint said format strings ) 
Doing that results in different kind of output (story )

Its a 32 bit hexadecimal but it doesnt correspond to any ascii values , it is most prolly the address value. 
I tried to run gdb to debug or find memory address based upon the breakpoints but that didnt lead anywhere :

We know till now that the flag is stored in some memory location off the stack and we have to access it , so running a for loop in the bash :

i ran fualty for loop ðŸ˜­ fixing that 

`for i in {0..999}; do echo "%$i\$s" | nc saturn.picoctf.net 56059 | grep -Ei pico;done `

I had to google and use chatgpt to get the -Ei part basically filters the case sensitive pico only and we are piping the output. 

FLAG=picoCTF{L34k1ng_Fl4g_0ff_St4ck_} is what i got but its not the flag

Running it again with ctf included to get the flag as
