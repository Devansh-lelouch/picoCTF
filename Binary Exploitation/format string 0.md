Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty! Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?
Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.
Please choose from the following burgers: Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe
Enter your recommendation:
```

Looking at the source code - 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c57e06b9-977d-45dc-83dc-aee86b988d45)

In the start only the BUFSIZE is limited to 32, so like in the challenge `Bufferoverflow 0` putting anything 
which has more characters than 32 would do right  ? 

( Didnt even have to look at the code and it worked hehehehe) 

The final terminal would be like 
```
kafka@Kafka:~$ nc mimas.picoctf.net 58809
