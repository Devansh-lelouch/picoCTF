# Solution 
we have two files ciphertext and one convert file . 
The ciphertext is like this : 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d4343d6-259c-4eff-bad5-a86966eb9844)

and the convert.py is like this :

Understanding the code : 
We have two keys lookup1 and lookup2. 
We take  the index (cur) of the character in lookup1 ( we input the char ) 
We then calculates the new index  in lookup2 based on the difference between cur and prev  using modulo 40. 

We can just reverse the process and get the flag to do so : 
We set the prev as 0 and the cur to look for the index in lookup2 instead of lookup1. 
we calculate the new index but we add the values of cur and prev and store it in out 

```
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char) 
  
  this= lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]
  out+= this
  prev = lookup1.index(this)
```

it will look like this. 

When we save this and provide it with the ciphertext via the terminal

It gives another python program . we give this the ciphertext to run to get the flag as :
